	<h2>Data Cleansing</h2>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Data cleansing, data cleaning or data scrubbing is the process of detecting and 
		correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. 
		Used mainly in databases, the term refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, 
		irrelevant, etc. parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting this dirty data or coarse data.</p>

	<h2>The Data Cleansing Solution</h2>
	<p>
		The solution cleanses company and person records. 
		It takes dirty company and person data as input and identifies 
		it by matching against a master data index.
		When a person or a company record is identified, 
		the solution adds a 
		unique identifier to the record from the master data index.
	</p>
	<p> 
		The unique identifier would typically be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Companies – Company number</li>
		<li>Persons – Social security number</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Once the company or person is identified then correcting, extending or updating the data is the next step.
		That is a different problem but it is easier than it would be before the cleansing.
